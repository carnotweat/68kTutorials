The hello world tutorial is the project written by Big Evil Corporation (http://bigevilcorporation.co.uk/2012/03/23/sega-megadrive-4-hello-world/). 

I have modified it to compile with ASMX since this assembler can be built on Linux.

Use build.sh to assemble the ROM - can be re-used for other projects as long as your top-level asm file is named main.asm. Build.sh assumes you have already built ASMX and installed the executable to /usr/local/bin
